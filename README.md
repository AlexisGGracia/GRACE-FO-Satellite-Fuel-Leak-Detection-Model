# GRACE-FO-Satellite-Fuel-Leak-Detection-Model in Python

# Introduction

In this project, I studied the evolution of the fuel leak of the GRACE-FO satellite. We considers mass flow rates of the thrusters, time intervals of thruster usage( delta-t), time interval of activation of thrusters, Internal pressure of the tanks, temperature in the zenith and nadir direction of the fuel tanks. In this projecgt, we study the evolution of the leak but model is a work in progress that is continously under development as we perform research on how we can translate our findings into a Markov Chain to predict the behavior of the fuel leak in the future for orbit raise strategies. During this research, we consider two methods to estimate and confirm the fuel leak of the tanks:
** METHOD 1: **
  -Using the mass flow rates to estimate the ideal mass inside of the tanks assuming no leaks 
** METHOD 2: **
  - Using Vander Waals Equation to find the mass inside of the fuel tanks at all times

Who is it for? This project was developed at The University of Texas at Austin as part of my Final Project for my Spacecraft Dynamics course taken during Fall 2023

# Code Breakdown and Workflow

This section provides a detailed explanation of the logic and steps involved in the code.

1. **Defines parameters such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, Greenwich Sidereal Meridian Time (GMST) at burnout, etc.**

   - Orbital elements such as semi-major axis, eccentricity are determined based on mission constraints such as altitude of orbiting spacecraft and desired orbit type.
   - Parameters defined are as follows:

   ```MATLAB
   % Defining parameters
   format longG
   a = 6500;                       % Semi-major axis (km)
   e = 0.001;                      % Orbit's eccentricity
   theta1 = 20*pi/180;             % Initial true anomaly at burnout
   GSMT = 0;                       % Greenwich Sidereal Meridian time at burnout
   mu_earth = 398600.4415;         % Gravitational parameter of Earth (km^3/s^2)
   R_earth = 6378.1363;            % Radius of Earth (km)
   J2 = 0.0010826267;              % J2 perturbations due to Earth's obliqueness
   w_earth = 2*pi / 86164;         % Earth's rotation rate
   n = 10;
   iterations = 4;
   i = 1;                          % Counting variable
   f = 3.353*10^-3;               % Earth's obliqueness constant
   height = 0;

     
         
2. **Using Katherine Johnson and Skopinski NASA technical notes, determine the burnout azimuth of the spacecraft.**

3. **Determine the orbital elements of the satellite at burnout** to achieve the goal of passing over a desired position after a precise number of revolutions.

4. **Propagate the orbit using ODE45 based on two-body dynamics**, including J2 perturbations.

5. **Determine the accuracy of the solution by:**
   - (a) **Generating groundtracks for the satellite**, including coastlines and the desired location on the map.
   - (b) **Plotting the satellite elevation relative to the desired location** over the time period when it should pass overhead.


### Important Notes

- **J2 Perturbations**: In this project, J2 perturbations (due to Earth's oblateness) are only considered during the **first iteration** of the burnout azimuth calculation.
                        This is because the primary goal of this calculation is to determine the **initial azimuth angle at burnout** required to position the spacecraft
                        over a target location immediately after burnout.
                        
  
- **First Iteration**: During the first iteration, J2 perturbations are included to refine the orbital parameters (such as inclination and node) at the moment of burnout.
                       These perturbations slightly affect the spacecraftâ€™s trajectory and need to be accounted for to ensure accurate initial positioning.

- **Subsequent Iterations**: For later iterations, J2 perturbations are **ignored**. This simplification is made because the subsequent calculations focus primarily on
                             placing the satellite in the desired position **immediately after burnout**. The long-term effects of J2 on the orbit (such as orbital precession)
                             are considered minimal for this immediate mission goal.

- **Why This Approach?**: The neglect of J2 in later iterations is a practical choice, as the impact of J2 on short-term positioning is minimal compared to the complexity
                          it would add to the calculations. For long-term mission planning, J2 and other perturbations should be modeled, but for the purposes of this burnout
                          azimuth determination, they do not significantly affect the accuracy of the placement.




  
## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following software and tools:

- **MATLAB**: Ensure that MATLAB is installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
- **MATLAB Toolboxes**: The following toolboxes are recommended for running the simulations:
  - Aerospace Toolbox
  - Mapping Toolbox
  - MATLAB functions which are included as separate files under this project 

### Additional Information:
The project uses MATLAB's built-in functions and toolboxes to perform orbital simulations, including two-body propagation, J2 perturbations, and groundtrack generation.

You can install necessary MATLAB packages directly through the MATLAB interface.


# Visual Results
In this section, I have included the groundtracks and an elevation plot relative to my desire location that demonstrates the accuracy of this model.

## Groundtracks: 

- **Groundtracks**: Starting location is along the coast of california and final destination is Austin, Texas. My mission was designed such that it completes this after 10th orbital periods.

## Elevation vs Time plot: 

- **Elevation Plot**: The elevation plot versus time plot helps track how the altitude of a spacecraft changes over time, providing valuable insight into its orbital path and visibility from a ground station or observation point. 
   - Since the final destination is Austin, Texas (right above the ground station) it shows that the final elevation is 90 degrees
